# Data-reshaping-transformation

The average business uses up to 13 different applications, therefore data is scattered amongst disparate systems. This results in poor communication between departments, systems and processes, leading to inability to meet both clientsâ€™ needs and business goals. Moreover, important decisions are based on misinformation, which can have disastrous effects. Data integration allows businesses to combine data residing in different sources to provide users with a real-time view of business performance. As a strategy, integration is the first step toward transforming data into meaningful and valuable information. 

This project aims at integrating data from multiple sources stored in different format, this allows the decision makers to make better-informed decision as well as reducing the time to access data from different sources.
